                    This is the very first photo of us together. Let me just
                    share a little bit of my experience of what happened during this day.
                    I really want to make a move on her though I get very shy, 
                    I really do get very shy at that time but my friends encouraged me
                    and I took the initiative to have a photo with her, after having a photo
                    with her it literally made me proud and happy knowing that I got
                    my very first photo of my crush.

                    This is the pandemic era, this is where we are stuck 
                    in our houses and we basically do online classes only though
                    even though we have that distance, we still got the time to bond with each other
                    and play with each other via <em> Call of Duty Mobile</em>. Everytime we play,
                    everytime we spoke in our cameras are the moment that I felt very happy.
                    Being able to have our interest sync at that time made me the happiest
                    person ever lived and I thank her so much for giving me that happiness.
